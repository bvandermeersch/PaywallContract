# PaywallContract

This contract accepts a set payment from anybody and records there address as paid.

This could be used as a paywall, they would make a one time payment and it records them in the smart contract.

You can restrict someones access to an area on your site unless they paid the fee.

If the getUser function returns true it means they paid.
